Hello there!

This is the 2nd version of my TryTest. TryTest are basically three test cases, which I wrote and tried automated (using Selenium WebDriver with Java 16 and TestNG).
Currently I'm working to get this automation on more advanced level (adding test suites, Page Object class and so on).
If You have any suggestions please share them at "kingmosses @ gmail . com" 

Thank You and have a nice day!
Greg
